## Lab Six Journal

Initially, it was challenging for Patrick and I to understand the requirements listed on the repository setup instructions. We discussed that Patrick will be the one who is responsible to create our pair coding repository and creating branches. However, I got confused of the instructions written that one of us needs to take responsibility on git commits, commits pushes and pulls, but at the same time I understand from Ali that both of us must have committed to our pair coding repository. The confusion escalates to the point that I was not sure the right working flow such as when to clone the repository . Should I clone it before Patrick creates the branches or after? 

However, after some practices on commit, push and pull, I understand that it does not matter if I clone the repository before or after. I can always perform git pull after my pair coder has committed and pushed to github. This pair coding lab is a very cool thing to do and I get a better understanding on git pull now.

The challenges in coding are always endless from understanding the instructions given and I always feel that I have misinterpreted the instructions although I managed to give the correct output and thinking that there must be some better and correct methods I should have done in my code.
